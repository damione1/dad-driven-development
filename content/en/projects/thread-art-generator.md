Designed and built a distributed Go application that transforms images into thread art designs with multiple coordinated services.

## Highlights

- Architected a system with API server, queue system, and worker services
- Implemented gRPC/Connect-RPC for efficient service communication
- Built error handling and retry mechanisms for reliable processing
- Created storage abstraction supporting multiple backends (S3, GCS, local)
- Developed efficient image processing algorithms in Go
- Created Docker configurations for development and production environments
